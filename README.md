# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The general goal of this project is to explore an already cleaned data set in Tableau and to create visualizations to better understand the trends of the data. In conjunction with these general trends, specific patterns and analyses will allow the user to answer specific questions. 

For my project, I chose option 2, sub-option 1: FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015. This data set contains records of wildlife strikes by air traffic over the span of 2000-2015. Within this data set several metrics will be explored including: the effect of these strikes on airplanes, the place and time of these strikes and the wildlife involved. The major questions that will be answered by this project will be twofold: 1) What financial burden do these incidents cause on air traffic and what may be done to alleviate?; 2) What environmental impacts do these incidents cause on animals involved with these strikes?. These goals may help implement very real solutions to this pressing issue for the aviation industry and environemtal efforts alike.

## Process
### Step 1: Data Connection
Connecting data to Tableau and exploring data types
### Step 2: EDA
Initial exploration efforts to understand by building preliminary models (about 5+ simple models) with the three different metrics in mind: Effect, When, Wildlife.
### Step 3: Create Meaningful Visualizations
To answer the questions that arose during EDA, the final visualizations were created to provide answers.
### Step 4: Create Dashboards / Storyboard
In continuing to answer the questions, a storyboard was constructed to implement all the varying visualizations into a compelling unified story.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Future Goals
Unfortunately the data set provided was only for the years of 2000-2015. A major goal would to update and clean existing data from the FAA and to update the models as such. This would provide more useful and up to date insights into the ongoing problem. Data should be taken from prior to 2000 as well as after 2015 to give more data insights into trends over a longer period of time.

Legislature and engineering advancements have also progressed since the tragic Eastern Air Lines Flight 375 bird strike incident in October of 1960 where 62 out of 77 people perished - the deadliest in aviation history. A useful question to pursue would be understanding if these legislative and engineering changes have made significant improvement in ongoing wildlife strike incidents over time.

Data sets regarding wildlife outcomes may also be explored in more detail to understand how these aviation accidents affect wildlife populations, cascading ecosystem effects and their consquences for biodiversity.
