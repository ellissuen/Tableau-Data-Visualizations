# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The general goal of this project is to explore an already cleaned data set in Tableau and to create visualizations to better understand the trends of the data. In conjunction with these general trends, specific patterns and analyses will allow the user to answer specific questions. 

For my project, I chose option 2, sub-option 1: FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015. This data set contains records of wildlife strikes by air traffic over the span of 2000-2015. Within this data set several metrics will be explored including: the effect of these strikes on airplanes, the place and time of these strikes and the wildlife involved. The major questions that will be answered by this project will be twofold: 1) What financial burden do these incidents cause on air traffic and what may be done to alleviate?; 2) What environmental impacts do these incidents cause on animals involved with these strikes?. These goals may help implement very real solutions to this pressing issue for the aviation industry and environemtal efforts alike.

## Process
### Step 1: Data Connection
Connecting data to Tableau and exploring data types
### Step 2: EDA
Initial exploration efforts to understand by building preliminary models (about 5+ simple models) with the three different metrics in mind: Effect, When, Wildlife.
### Step 3: Create Meaningful Visualizations
To answer the questions that arose during EDA, the final visualizations were created to provide answers.
### Step 4: Create Dashboards / Storyboard
In continuing to answer the questions, a storyboard was constructed to implement all the varying visualizations into a compelling unified story.

## Results
Option 2 - FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015

Questions:
1) What are the financial ramifications of wildlife strikes on the aviation industry?
2) What are the environmental ramifications of wildlife strikes on local ecosystems?

Through exploratory visualizations as well as the 15 visualizations included in the attached presentation, many conclusions can be reached. In general, wildlife strikes happen all over continental US but incidents are most common nearby busy airports and busy population zones. These include the East Coast around New York, the West Coast in California, and some other land locked airport hubs like Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Salt Lake City and Chicago O'Hare. The number of incidents year over year have been increasing steadily and are forecasted to continue to increase. Over 95% of incidents involve birds and thus, wildlife strikes and bird strikes will be used interchangably for the remainder of these results.

When looking at general trends, the larger the airport (ie more flights) the more incidents of bird strikes can be predicted to occur. For all airports, strikes happen more often in the day compared to night time. Usually these incidents also do no damage to the aircraft and have no effect to the flight. The phases of flights that are affected are most commonly the approach, landing roll and take off run. There are no reported incldents while cruising at high altitudes. These trends are applicable to all airports whether big or small.

Financially, wildlife strikes have costed the aviation industry a total of over $ 300 million over the span of the 15 year collected data. The majority of this cost however impacts smaller planes - mostly planes with 1-2 engines. Though many bird strikes cause minor or no damage at all, these smaller planes are unproportionately affected, leading to destroyed aircraft or substantially damaged aircraft outcomes. Many hundred of these occurances have been recorded compared to only 3 occurances of a larger airplane (4 or more engines) being destroyed by bird strikes. For aircraft that are damaged, high cost damages (>$2 million) are fixed generally quickly leading to a smaller amount of time out of service. However there are many lower damages (<$1 million) that have a large amount of time out of service. This may be due to the fact that higher damage incidents may involve a larger airplane (ie. one that belongs to an airline). The airline has the financial motive to repair these damages quickly compared to private owners of smaller plane who may not have the financial means to do so in a timely manner. Other conclusions that can be drawn are the fact that the bird strikes involving the Canadian Goose account for 1/3 of the total costs to the aviation industry. There also in no significant increase in the number of damaged aircraft (even though incidents are on the rise). 

Some applications for the results may include legislative financial help towards owners of smaller aircraft to be able to recover monetarily since private owners seem to be dispropotionately affected the most. Geese also potentially cause some of the most damage in bird strikes due to their large size and their tendancy to flock. Research into mitigation or goose deterance may be worth millions per year. A promising sign is the fact that even though incidents are increasing every year, there is no correlated significant increase of damaged aircraft. This may be due to the ongoing legislative and engineering efforts which may have mitigated the worst cases. However, more research and data collection will be needed to understand the entirety of the situation.

Environmentally, bird strike cause fatalities to many animals annually. As expected, the species affected are dependant on locality and reflect the local bird ranges. Though not explicitly recorded in dataset, there were over 2000 incidents recorded in 2014 alone. With each bird strike involving potentially an entire flock of birds, the number of animals affected can be estimated to be in the tens of thousands per year. The species that are affects the most are: Barn Swallows, European Starlings, Gulls, Mourning Doves, and Sparrows. In the last 5 years (2009-2014) incidents involving the Barn Swallow has topped all other species. It is also worth noting that bird strikes distribution of species involved are uniform no matter what time of the day it is.

More data will be needed to understand the scope of these effects on local ecosystems. However, a good place to begin research or data collection may be to look at these top 5 or 10 species affected. The complexity of the cascading effects of the species on food webs and ecosytem balance should be examined for several generations. Though bird stikes involving barn swallows, which are more abundant, may not cause as much long term effects, bird strikes involving species like the red-tailed hawk, which are a keystone species, may cause lasting and irreparable damage.

## Challenges 
One major challenge was that the data was quite limited in terms of time coverage as well as other pertinent information. The data only included year 2000-2015 which meant that the conclusions and forecasts were not up to date. In order for a more accurate representation of the current situation, more current data would have to be obtained. 

The forecasts therefore also suffered. It was not statistically reasonable to forecast for the year 2024 since the spread of data over the previous 9 years would not have been a reliable representation of how the airline industry has changed in response to the threat of wildlife strikes. Instead a much more reasonable 6 quarter forecast was concluded for the sake of the accuracy of this project.

Other important information that could have been included are: where on the airplane damages occured; casualties involved if any; airline or owner; fault (FAA / manufacturing recommendations not followed). More data about the specifics of the situations may have yield some more substantial and specific questions on which to find conclusions for.

## Future Goals
Unfortunately the data set provided was only for the years of 2000-2015. A major goal would to update and clean existing data from the FAA and to update the models as such. This would provide more useful and up to date insights into the ongoing problem. Data should be taken from prior to 2000 as well as after 2015 to give more data insights into trends over a longer period of time.

Legislature and engineering advancements have also progressed since the tragic Eastern Air Lines Flight 375 bird strike incident in October of 1960 where 62 out of 77 people perished - the deadliest in aviation history. A useful question to pursue would be understanding if these legislative and engineering changes have made significant improvement in ongoing wildlife strike incidents over time. 

Data sets regarding wildlife outcomes may also be explored in more detail to understand how these aviation accidents affect wildlife populations, cascading ecosystem effects and their consquences for biodiversity.
